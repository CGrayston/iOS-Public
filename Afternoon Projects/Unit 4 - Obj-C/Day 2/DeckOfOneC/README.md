# DeckOfCardsC

## Summary 
Students will build a simple app to practice creating Models from JSON, initializing those models with a dictionary, and basic networking in Objective-C. Students will also learn how to bridge their Objective-C code with their Swift code. 

## Overview

### Step 1 - Understand the RESTful API, Models
* understand how Objective-C handles and creates models
* understand how `h` and `m` files work together
* create custom model object with dictionary 'failable' initializer


### Step 2 - Controller
* create a model object controller with a `+ (void)drawCardWithCompletion:(void (^)(DVMCard *))completion` 
* create a method that fetches an image with a cards image url, and turns it into a `UIImage`

### Step 3 - User Interface / Bridging Swift and Objective-C
* create a `Bridging-Header.h` file that bridges our Objective-C code and our Swift code
* wire up the UI and create an action that draws a card and displays it to the user      

## Part 1 - Understanding the JSON and Creating Models

### JSON 

Go to `http://deckofcardsapi.com/` and read over the documentation for drawing a single card

1. Once you've found the correct endpoint to acheieve the goal of our app, start analyzing the JSON, and start mapping out what types are needed to parse this into our model object.

    <Details>
        <summary> Code Hint </summary>

    ```json
    { 
    "remaining": 51,
    "cards": [ 
        {
        "suit": "DIAMONDS",
        "value": "2",
        "code": "2D",
        "images": {
            "svg": "https://deckofcardsapi.com/static/img/2D.svg",
            "png": "https://deckofcardsapi.com/static/img/2D.png"
        },
        "image": "https://deckofcardsapi.com/static/img/2D.png" 
        }
    ]
    } 
    ```
    </Details>


* Note: Codable does not work in ObjectiveC, therefore we will be using `NSJSONSerialization` to parse this into our model object. Pay extra close attention to how the JSON is structured

### Model

Create a `Card` model class that will hold a `imageUrlAsString`

1. Add a new `Card` class as an `NSObject` subclass
    * Note: Becasue with how Objective-C handles namespacing, you'll have to make it <#YourInitials#>Card. In the master attached to the project, card will be named `DVMCard`. For the README we will just refer to it as `Card`

2.  Add properties for `imageUrlAsString` 
    <Details>
        <summary> Code Hint </summary>

    ```objc
    @property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *imageUrlString;
    ```
    </Details>

3. Add an initializer that takes in an `NSDictionary`. This will need to match the JSON from the Card API
    * Note: The Card API gives us back an array of cards, even when we're asking to draw just one. You can call `.firstObject` on `NSArray`. Try to do this without checking the Code Hint!
        <Details>
        <summary> Code Hint </summary>

        ```objc
        - (instancetype)initWithDictionary:(NSDictionary *)dictionary
        {
        self = [super init];
        
        if (self) {
            NSArray *cards = dictionary[@"cards"];
            NSDictionary *cardDictionary = cards.firstObject;
            NSString *imageURlAsString = cardDictionary[@"image"];
            _imageUrlString = imageURlAsString;
        }
        return self;
        }
  
    </Details>


## Part 2 - Writing the Model Controller

### Model Controller 

Create a model controller called `<YourInitials>CardController` that will manage drawing a card, and then fetching the cards image with the cards image URL, and turning it into a `UIImage`. We will  use static methods that use completions.

1. Add a new `CardController`  class as an `NSObject` subclass

2. Create a `+(void) drawCardWithCompletion: (void (^) (DVMCard *))completion`  method that uses an `NSURLSessionDataTask` to to parse your endpoint into an `NSDictionary`, and then into a `Card`
    * Note: We'll dive deeper into this method in a moment

3.  Create a `+ (void) fetchCardImageWithCard: (DVMCard *) card completion: (void (^) (UIImage *)) completion;` method that will take a `Card` as a parameter and use it's `imageUrlString` to make a dataTask and turn that data into `UIImage`

### Draw Card method

This method is going to be following the same three steps that your previous methods from networking in Swift follow: 
* URL -> Request(If necessary) -> DataTask + Resume -> Serialize / Decode that data into our model objects

1. Make sure you got the correct endpoint, and then paste that URL into `[NSURL initWithString:]` initializer. 
    * Note: You can hardcode the draw count query to `1`

        <Details>
        <summary> Code Hint </summary>

        ```objc
        NSURL *url = [[NSURL alloc] initWithString:@"https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/draw/?count=1"];
    </Details>

2. Because we're only doing a `GET` request, and we're not working with any headers, we can omit the `NSURLRequest`

3. Call `NSURLSession` with the `sharedSession`, and then call `dataTaskWithURL:completionHandler:` method. Be sure to resume it

    <Details>
    <summary> Code Hint </summary>

    ```objc
    [[[NSURLSession sharedSession] dataTaskWithURL:url completionHandler:^(NSData * _Nullable data, NSURLResponse * _Nullable response, NSError * _Nullable error) {
        // YOUR SERIALIZATION CODE HERE
    }
    }]resume];
</Details>

4. Check for an error, and then check if you receieved data back. If not, do `completion(nil);` and return

5. Use `NSJSONSerialization` to serialize your data into an `NSDictionary`

    <Details>
    <summary> Code Hint </summary>

    ```objc
        NSDictionary *jsonDictionary = [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:data options:NSJSONReadingAllowFragments error:&error];
</Details>

6. Use the dictionary from above to initialize a `Card`, and then call completion using it

    <Details>
    <summary> Code Hint </summary>

    ```objc
        DVMCard *card = [[DVMCard new] initWithDictionary:jsonDictionary];
        completion(card);
</Details>


<Details>
<summary> Here's the full drawCardWithCompletion: (void (^) (DVMCard *))completion method. Only look if you get very stuck! </summary>

```objc
+ (void)drawCardWithCompletion:(void (^)(DVMCard *))completion
{
    // URL
    NSURL *url = [[NSURL alloc] initWithString:@"https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/draw/?count=1"];
    
    // DataTask+Resume
    [[[NSURLSession sharedSession] dataTaskWithURL:url completionHandler:^(NSData * _Nullable data, NSURLResponse * _Nullable response, NSError * _Nullable error) {
        if (error) {
            completion(nil);
            return;
        }
        if (data == nil) {
            completion(nil);
            return;
        }
        NSDictionary *jsonDictionary = [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:data options:NSJSONReadingAllowFragments error:&error];
        if (jsonDictionary == nil) {
            completion(nil);
            return;
        }
        DVMCard *card = [[DVMCard new] initWithDictionary:jsonDictionary];
        completion(card);
    }]resume];
} 
```
</Details>

### Fetch Image method

This method is going to be similar to the `drawCardWithCompletion` method, however we won't need to do any `NSJSONSerialization` because you can initialize a `UIImage` with the data from the `dataTask`

* Note: You will need to `#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>`

1. With the `Card` being passed into the function, create an `NSURL` from the `Card`'s `imageUrlString` property. 

2. Because we're only doing a `GET` request, and we're not working with any headers, we can omit the `NSURLRequest` 

3. Call `NSURLSession` with the `sharedSession`, and then call `dataTaskWithURL:completionHandler:` method. Be sure to resume it

4. Check for errors, and then check if you were able to get data back

5. With the data, initialize a `UIImage` and call completion


## Part 3 - Bridging Swift and Objective C

### Add Bridging File 
When you try to add a new Swift file, XCode will automatically ask if you want to add a bridging file. Say yes to this, and this will be where you import all your Objective-C headers that you'll be able to access in Swift

1. Create a new Cocoa Touch Class file of type `UIViewController` named `CardViewController`. Make sure you set the languge to Swift

2. When Xcode prompts you to create a bridging file, say yes.

3. Open the `Bridging-Header.h` file and import both headers for your model controller and your model


### User Interface

1. Hook up your `IBOutlets` and `IBActions` from Interface Builder. Have an action for the draw button and an outlet for the card image view.

2. Inside the `IBAction` for the draw button, call your draw card method. Inside the completion of the draw card method, call your fetch image for card method.

3. Once the image for the card comes back. call `DispatchQueue.main.asyc{}` to set the image of the card image view on the main thread

    <Details>
    <summary> Code Hint </summary>

    ```swift
        @IBAction func drawButtonTapped(_ sender: Any) {
        UIApplication.shared.isNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible = true
        DVMCardController.drawCard { (card) in
            guard let card = card else { return }
            DVMCardController.fetchCardImage(with: card, completion: { [weak self] (image) in
                guard let image = image else { return }
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    UIApplication.shared.isNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible = false
                    self?.cardImageView.image = image
                }
            })
        }
    }

</Details>
