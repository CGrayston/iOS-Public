# Deck of One C

## Summary 

## Overview

### Step 1 - Understand the RESTful API, Models
* understand how Objective-C handles and creates models
* understand how `h` and `m` files work together
* create custom model object with dictionary 'failable' initializer


### Step 2 - Controller
* create a model object controller with a `+ (void)drawCardWithCompletion:(void (^)(DVMCard *))completion` 
* create a method that fetches an image with a cards image url, and turns it into a `UIImage`

### Step 3 - User Interface / Bridging Swift and Objective-C
* create a `Bridging-Header.h` file that bridges our Objective-C code and our Swift code
* wire up the UI and create an action that draws a card and displays it to the user      

## Part 1 - Understanding the JSON and Creating Models

### JSON 

Go to `http://deckofcardsapi.com/` and read over the documentation for drawing a single card. 

1. Once you've found the correct endpoint to acheieve the goal of our app, start analyzing the JSON, and start mapping out what types are needed to parse this into our model object.

        <summary> Code Hint </summary>

    ```json
    { // <--- Top Level
    "remaining": 51,
    "cards": [ // <--- Array of cards, we only want the first
        {
        "suit": "DIAMONDS",
        "value": "2",
        "code": "2D",
        "images": {
            "svg": "https://deckofcardsapi.com/static/img/2D.svg",
            "png": "https://deckofcardsapi.com/static/img/2D.png"
        },
        "image": "https://deckofcardsapi.com/static/img/2D.png" // <--- This is what we're after
        }
    ]
    } 
    ```
    </Details>


* Note: Codable does not work in ObjectiveC, therefore we will be using `NSJSONSerialization` to parse this into our model object
